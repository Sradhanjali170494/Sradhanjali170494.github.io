AstroidSmash is a mini captivating 2D game developed using the Unity game engine, centered around the theme of the universe. In this immersive experience, players are tasked with defending our planet from various threats, including a supernova, incoming asteroids, and an alien invasion.

The focal point of the game is our central asteroid, which players must strategically expand by colliding it with asteroids of the same color. Additionally, players have the ability to swap adjacent asteroids (excluding the central one) to further increase its size while eliminating asteroids of different colors. The game offers customization options such as adjusting the force and spawn rate to enhance gameplay dynamics.

Implementing advanced mechanics, the game employs Reinforcement Learning for the alien ship, an enemy entity programmed to target and destroy our asteroid while also defending itself.

To gauge the health of our asteroid, a stress meter is provided, with players initially equipped with 98 shields for protection and another 98 life points to bolster the asteroid's size.
