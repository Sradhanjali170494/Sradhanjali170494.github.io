importance: 3

The AI-based robot operates autonomously, with the integration of the ROS framework and artificial intelligence package being essential. The project aims to mimic human behavior, with robots sensing data from sensors and making decisions using AI algorithms, similar to how humans use their five senses to decide on actions. In technical terms, sensor data is published by a ROS publisher, subscribed to by the project, and then fed into a machine learning model for prediction. The decisions made by the machine learning model are published by a publisher, subscribed to by the project, and acted upon accordingly.
