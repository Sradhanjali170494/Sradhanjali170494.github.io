The AI-based robot operates autonomously, with the integration of the ROS framework and artificial intelligence package being essential. The project aims to mimic human behavior, with robots sensing data from sensors and making decisions using AI algorithms, similar to how humans use their five senses to decide on actions. In technical terms, sensor data is published by a ROS publisher, subscribed to by the project, and then fed into a machine learning model for prediction. The decisions made by the machine learning model are published by a publisher, subscribed to by the project, and acted upon accordingly.

Before the implementation of computer vision tasks into a robot. We do a simulation to try to check how computer vision tasks should work in the above video. 

## Real life implementation demo

The above video is about a real-life implementation demo of a robot in our workspace.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

cd mina

catkin_make

roslaunch base_rover base_rover.launch   # most important, when we lunch this , all sensor throw data throw node, so we just need to collect this data and do process
