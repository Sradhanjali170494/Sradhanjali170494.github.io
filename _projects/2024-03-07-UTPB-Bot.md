In this project, we describe the development and implementation of a chatbot for the University of Texas Permian
Basin (UTPB). The chatbot is designed to provide information and answer questions from students, faculty, staff,
and prospective students. It is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and leverages various
university resources to provide comprehensive and informative responses. We discuss the chatbotâ€™s architecture,
its key features, and the evaluation process. The results show that the chatbot is able to understand and respond
to a wide range of questions with high accuracy. We believe that the chatbot has the potential to be a valuable tool
for improving communication and access to information at UTPB.
