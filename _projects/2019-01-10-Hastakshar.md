"Signature has been one of the widely used biometric verification methods. Handwritten signatures are utilized in cheques, forms, letters, applications, minutes, etc. Each individual's signature is unique in nature, which is why it is essential to uniquely identify a person's handwritten signature.

The signature verification system presents an investigation into using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Writer-Dependent models in signature verification."
