Creating a model that replicates the functionality of the human eye is challenging. Tasks such as object detection, face recognition, depth calculation, and object tracking are complex and typically require separate machine learning models. In this project, I aim to integrate multiple computer vision models into a single function to emulate the capabilities of the human eye.
