Saveme is a 2D game that draws inspiration from the life of a prisoner attempting to break free from captivity. The player controls a central ball representing the prisoner and navigates obstacles to escape from the cage. The mobile screen is divided into two vertical areas: the right side to move the ball rightward and the left side to move the ball leftward.
